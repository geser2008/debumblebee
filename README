DESCRIPTION

This is a fork/major rewrite of original bumblebee project. I've made this fork
because I was very unsatisfied with current bumblebee installation script which
was a real mess. The main point of this project is to create polished and
modular version of bumblebee.

This project allows you to utilize nVidia graphics card with proprietary driver
while running main desktop on Intel card. This service is only for Intel/nVidia
combination, it won't work with Intel/ATI or any other combination.

debumblebee is combination of additional X server for nVidia graphics card and
VirtualGL package which allows to access nVidia X server screen from Intel X
server screen with full OpenGL support.

Right now this script supports only Debian and LinuxMint based on Debian. Feel
free to add support of any other distro. I'll gladly accept your changes. If you
have any questions about adding support please check INSTALL file for detailed
instructions of what should be done by installation script.


USAGE

Check INSTALL file for details. After installation your desktop and all
applications will be running on Intel card. To run application with nVidia card
you need to start it with optirun, for example: "optirun glxgears". To start a
32 bit application on 64 bit arch you should use optirun32.


LIMITATIONS

Right now VDPAU video playback isn't supported.


TODO

* Improve power save support. Add list of working acpi_call laptop models with
  confirmed working command strings.
* Rewrite optirun with perl, so it can use SGID bit which allows to apply more
  strict security permissions and get rid of sudoers file.
